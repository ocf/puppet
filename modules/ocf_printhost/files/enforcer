"""Enforcer is a prehook and posthook for Tea4CUPS whose primary purpose is to
add and subtract from page quotas as user jobs are processed.

When a user sends a job to the print server, Tea4CUPS passes the job as a
PostScript file to enforcer before sending it to the printer. Enforcer calls
reads PostScript comments to count pages and connects to mysql to check against
the user's quota. If enforcer returns 255 (a.k.a. -1), the job is rejected.
Otherwise, enforcer gets called again when the job is done and logs the job in
mysql, taking care to set the page count to zero if an error was encountered.

Another function of enforcer is to send notifications to desktops to let users
know when a job has been sent to the printer, been rejected due to the quota,
finished printing, or failed to print.
