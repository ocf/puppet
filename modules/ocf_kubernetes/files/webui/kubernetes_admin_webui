# Restrict access to the Kubernetes WebUI to ocfroot users only.
# We do this because it allows some very destructive actions.

# Note that this PAM service is used only for authentication to the nginx
# proxy. The WebUI does not support PAM itself-- instead, we pass a bearer token
# which authenticates to an admin user.
