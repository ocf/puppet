# This class exists to abstract out accesses to the puppet private share so
# that octocatalog-diff can generally ignore them and replace the file contents
# with dummy contents. It does not and should not have access to the private
# share, since it could accidentally leak secrets and will show output in
# jenkins logs that are public.
#
# Initially this defined type didn't exist and conditionals using the were used
# around everything that used the private share. This worked ok, but led to
# dependency issues where a resource that would normally exist was then hidden
# behind a conditional and wouldn't be seen by octocatalog-diff. This approach
# is better because it can provide a dummy file and a more consistent
# experience across all uses of the private share.
#
# This also gives a convenient interface to enforce file parameters like
# show_diff and backup that we don't want to be set to true for any private
# resources.
