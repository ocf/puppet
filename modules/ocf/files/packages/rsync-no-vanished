# Wrapper around rsync that won't exit nonzero if some files vanished before
# transferring.
#
# This is useful when doing backups because if any files are deleted between
# when we make the file list and when we copy the files, which is fairly
# common with lots of files that change a lot.
#
# This is a slightly modified version of a script distributed with the rsync
# project, but not with the Debian package.
#
# It was originally downloaded from:
# https://download.samba.org/pub/unpacked/rsync/support/rsync-no-vanished
#
# It was modified to work with rsync in server mode (by not clobbering stdout
# when grepping out errors).
