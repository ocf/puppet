"""A script to send an email to the root mailing list upon failure of
the convert program, when used in the raster-filter script, a
Tea4CUPS filter.

Jobs printed from one of the desktops, or from supernova or tsunami,
first go through raster-filter, which calls convert to reduce the
density of any PDFs, essentially rasterizing them. If convert happens
to fail, raster-filter will pipe stderr from convert to this script,
which takes in stdin and includes it in an email to root@ocf. Thus,
this script should not be called casually by regular users!
