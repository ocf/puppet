## This is a sample configuration file for the ftpsync mirror script. ##
## Most of the values are commented out and just shown here for       ##
## completeness, together with their default value.                   ##

########################################################################

## Mirrorname. This is used for things like the trace file and should always
## be the full hostname of the mirror.
MIRRORNAME=mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu

## Destination of the mirrored files. Should be an empty directory.
## CAREFUL, this directory will contain the mirror. Everything else
## that might have happened to be in there WILL BE GONE after the mirror sync!
TO="/opt/mirrors/ftp/debian"

## The upstream name of the rsync share.
##
## You can find out what share names your upstream mirror supports by running
## rsync YOURUPSTREAMSERVER::
## (You might have to export RSYNC_USER/RSYNC_PASSWORD for this to work)
#RSYNC_PATH="debian"

## The host we mirror from
RSYNC_HOST=debian.osuosl.org

## In case we need a user to access the rsync share at our upstream host
#RSYNC_USER=

## If we need a user we also need a password
#RSYNC_PASSWORD=

## In which directory should logfiles end up
## Note that BASEDIR defaults to $HOME, but can be set before calling the
## ftpsync script to any value you want (for example using pam_env)
#LOGDIR="${BASEDIR}/log"

## Name of our own logfile.
## Note that ${NAME} is set by the ftpsync script depending on the way it
## is called. See README for a description of the multi-archive capability
## and better always include ${NAME} in this path.
#LOG="${LOGDIR}/${NAME}.log"

## The script can send logs (or error messages) to a mail address.
## If this is unset it will default to the local root user unless it is run
## on a .debian.org machine where it will default to the mirroradm people.
#MAILTO="root"

## If you do want a mail about every single sync, set this to false
## Everything else will only send mails if a mirror sync fails
#ERRORSONLY="true"

## If you want the logs to also include output of rsync, set this to true.
## Careful, the logs can get pretty big, especially if it is the first mirror
## run
#FULLLOGS="false"

## If you do want to exclude files from the mirror run, put --exclude statements here.
## See rsync(1) for the exact syntax, these are passed to rsync as written here.
## DO NOT TRY TO EXCLUDE ARCHITECTURES OR SUITES WITH THIS, IT WILL NOT WORK!
#EXCLUDE=""

## If you do want to exclude an architecture, this is for you.
## Use as space seperated list.
## Possible values are:
## alpha, amd64, arm, armel, armhf, hppa, hurd-i386, i386, ia64, kfreebsd-amd64,
## kfreebsd-i386, m68k, mipsel, mips, powerpc, s390, s390x, sh, sparc and source
## eg. ARCH_EXCLUDE="alpha arm armel mipsel mips s390 sparc"
## An unset value will mirror all architectures (default!)

# ARCH_EXCLUDE=""

## Do we have leaf mirror to signal we are done and they should sync?
## If so set it to true and make sure you configure runmirrors.mirrors
## and runmirrors.conf for your need.
#HUB=false

## We do create three logfiles for every run. To save space we rotate them, this
## defines how many we keep
#LOGROTATE=14

## Our own lockfile (only one sync should run at any time)
#LOCK="${TO}/Archive-Update-in-Progress-${MIRRORNAME}"

# Timeout for the lockfile, in case we have bash older than v4 (and no /proc)
# LOCKTIMEOUT=${LOCKTIMEOUT:-3600}

## The following file is used to make sure we will end up with a correctly
## synced mirror even if we get multiple pushes in a short timeframe
#UPDATEREQUIRED="${TO}/Archive-Update-Required-${MIRRORNAME}"

## Number of seconds to sleep before retrying to sync whenever upstream
## is found to be updating while our update is running
#UIPSLEEP=1200

## Number of times the update operation will be retried when upstream
## is found to be updating while our update is running.
## Note that these are retries, so: 1st attempt + retries = total attempts
#UIPRETRIES=3

## The trace file is used by a mirror check tool to see when we last
## had a successful mirror sync. Make sure that it always ends up in
## project/trace and always shows the full hostname.
## This is *relative* to ${TO}
#TRACE="project/trace/${MIRRORNAME}"

## The trace file can have different format/contents. Here you can select
## what it will be.
## Possible values are
## "full"  - all information
## "terse" - basic, timestamp only (date -u)
## "touch" - just touch the file in existance
## "none"  - no tracefile at all
##
## Default and required value for Debian mirrors is full.
#EXTENDEDTRACE="full"

## We sync our mirror using rsync (everything else would be insane), so
## we need a few options set.
## The rsync program
#RSYNC=rsync

## Extra rsync options as defined by the local admin.
## There is no default by ftpsync.
##
## Please note that these options are added to EVERY rsync call.
## Also note that these are added at the beginning of the rsync call, as
## the very first set of options.
## Please ensure you do not add a conflict with the usual rsync options as
## shown below.
# RSYNC_EXTRA=""

## limit I/O bandwidth. Value is KBytes per second, unset or 0 means unlimited
#RSYNC_BW=""

## BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE RSYNC_OPTIONS! BETTER DON'T!
## BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE RSYNC_OPTIONS! BETTER DON'T!
## BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE RSYNC_OPTIONS! BETTER DON'T!
## BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU CHANGE THE RSYNC_OPTIONS! BETTER DON'T!

## Files that must *never* be deleted by rsync. These are files handled
## internally by ftpsync and will be created, updated, and deleted when
## appropriate.
#RSYNC_FILTER="--filter=protect_Archive-Update-in-Progress-${MIRRORNAME} --filter=protect_${TRACE} --filter=protect_Archive-Update-Required-${MIRRORNAME}"

## Default rsync options every rsync invocation sees.
#RSYNC_OPTIONS="-prltvHSB8192 --timeout 3600 --stats ${RSYNC_FILTER}"

## Options the first pass gets. We do not want the Packages/Source indices
## here, and we also do not want to delete any files yet.
#RSYNC_OPTIONS1="--exclude=Packages* --exclude=Sources* --exclude=Release* --exclude=InRelease --exclude=i18n/* --exclude=ls-lR*"

## Options the second pass gets. Now we want the Packages/Source indices too
## and we also want to delete files. We also want to delete files that are
## excluded.
#RSYNC_OPTIONS2="--max-delete=40000 --delay-updates --delete --delete-excluded"

## You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the environment
## variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to your web proxy.  Note
## that your web proxy's configuration must support proxy connections to port 873.
# RSYNC_PROXY=


## The following three options are used in case we want to "callback" the host
## we got pushed from.
#CALLBACKUSER="archvsync"
#CALLBACKHOST="none"
#CALLBACKKEY="none"


## Hook scripts can be run at various places during the sync.
## Leave them blank if you don't want any
## Hook1: After lock is acquired, before first rsync
## Hook2: After first rsync, if successful
## Hook3: After second rsync, if successful
## Hook4: Right before leaf mirror triggering
## Hook5: After leaf mirror trigger, only if we have slave mirrors (HUB=true)
##
## Note that Hook3 and Hook4 are likely to be called directly after each other.
## Difference is: Hook3 is called *every* time the second rsync was successful,
## but even if the mirroring needs to re-run thanks to a second push.
## Hook4 is only effective if we are done with mirroring.
#HOOK1=
