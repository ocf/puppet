# Required: The the directory holding your copy of all of the modules you
# mirror.  Does not include any module name
DESTD="<%= @mirror_path %>"

# Required: The file in which to store the last mirror time.
# Note: this really should not be in the repository itself.
TIMEFILE="<%= @project_timefile %>"

# Other settings
# The remote host to rsync from, not including a module name
REMOTE="<%= @remote_host %>"

# The master module, which holds the other modules
# Note that the mirror you pull from MUST have this master module.  You cannot
# use quick-fedora-mirror to pull from a host which does not have a master
# module containing the other modules.

# The name of the file holding the file list on the mirror host Note: the

# in context, and so the '$' must be escaped or the string quoted.
# FILELIST='fullfiletimelist-$mdir'

# An array of extra file lists to be transferred.  They won't be processed, but
# will implicitly be included in every transfer because file lists can't be
# included in the file lists.  '$mdir' is substituted as above.

# those extra files even in unchanged modules.

# Will be modified automatically according to VERBOSITY level; no need to set
# -q, -v or --info here.
#
# You can add excludes here, but the script will always detect those files as
# missing and will add them back to the file list.  This may generate
# complaints from rsync, but should not cause any problems, though it is almost
# certainly better to use the provided FILTEREXP to do exclusion instead.
#
# Note that some of these options may be required for proper operation of the
# script.  You really should be careful if you change things here, as the
# default value is carefully crafted and rsync can react in unexpected ways to
# seeminly compatible sets of arguments.

# Define KEEPDIRTIMES (to anything) to make a third rsync call which restores
# the timestamps of any directories which were modified after file removal.
# This won't ensure that timestamps are always up to date, but its good enough
# if you don't modify your repository locally.  Maintaining directory
# timestamps isn't important for mirroring in any case.
# KEEPDIRTIMES=

# DEFINE CHECKIN_SITE and CHECKIN_PASSWORD to perform a mirrormanager checkin
# at the completion of the run if rsync succeeded without error.  These values
# should match the master site name and site password you have configured in
# mirrormanager.
# CHECKIN_HOST will default to the output of the hostname command; you must set
# it manually if that does not match the hostname you have configured in
# mirrormanager.
# The "curl", "bzip2" and "base64" commands must be installed in order to
# perform mirrormanager checkins.

# If you have configured multiple mirrormanager hostnames to virtually
# spread the modules/categories you mirror between them, then you can configure
# per-module checkin hosts with variables liks the following.
# If a specific CHECKIN_HOST_* setting is not configured, then CHECKIN_HOST
# above will be used.
# Note that the module name is used, not the mirrormanager category, and that
# '-' in the module name is replaced by '_' to make a legal variable name.
# Most sites will hnot need this; it is only necessary when you mirror too many
# modules for mirrormanager to handle in a single checkin or crawl.

# mktemp will be called after this file is sourced to make a temporary

# A regular expression used to filter the file lists. It must be quoted (or

# and are expected not to be present locally. They will also be ignored by
# quick-fedora-hardlink. Cannot contain commas. Run against the file list that
# includes sizes (by quick-fedora-mirror) and the fullfiletimelist (by
# quick-fedora-hardlink), so don't use expressions that would match those
# metadata (which are digit strings and single characters). Example is a heavy
# filter which gives you an x86_64-only mirror with source packages, debuginfo
# packages, Alpha and Beta releases, and most image files excluded.
