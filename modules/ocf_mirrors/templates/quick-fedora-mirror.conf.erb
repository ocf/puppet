# Configuration file for quick-fedora-mirror
# This file is sourced by the shell and must be in valid sh syntax.

#### Required settings
# Required: The the directory holding your copy of all of the modules you
# mirror.  Does not include any module name
DESTD=<%= @mirror_path %>

# Required: The file in which to store the last mirror time.
# Note: this really should not be in the repository itself.
TIMEFILE=<%= @project_timefile %>

# Other settings
# The remote host to rsync from, not including a module name
REMOTE=<%= @remote_host %>

# The master module, which holds the other modules
# Note that the mirror you pull from MUST have this master module.  You cannot
# use quick-fedora-mirror to pull from a host which does not have a master
# module containing the other modules.
MASTERMODULE=<%= @master_module %>

# Tier 1 Fedora mirrors should uncomment the following to get the proper
# pre-bitflip content.
# MASTERMODULE=fedora-buffet0
# PREBITFLIP=1

# Define if the entire repository (all modules under fedora-buffet) should be
# mirrored.  If set, MODULES (below) is ignored
# MIRRORBUFFET=

# An array containing the modules to be mirrored
MODULES=(<%= @rsync_module %>)

# The name of the file holding the file list on the mirror host Note: the
# string '$mdir' will be replaced with the name of the current module directory
# in context, and so the '$' must be escaped or the string quoted.
# FILELIST='fullfiletimelist-$mdir'

# An array of extra file lists to be transferred.  They won't be processed, but
# will implicitly be included in every transfer because file lists can't be
# included in the file lists.  '$mdir' is substituted as above.
# Note that if you change this, you will want to do a run with -a to pick up
# those extra files even in unchanged modules.
# EXTRAFILES=(fullfilelist imagelist-\$mdir)

# Mapping of MODULES to directory names, as an associative array
# MODULEMAPPING=(fedora-alt alt  fedora-archive archive

# curl binary (only if MirrorManager checkins are enabled; see below).
# CURL=/usr/bin/curl

# rsync binary
RSYNC=/usr/bin/rsync

# Rsync timeout value, in seconds
# Will be passed to rsync via --timeout.
RSYNCTIMEOUT=100

# Array of default options to pass to rsync
# Will be modified automatically according to VERBOSITY level; no need to set
# -q, -v or --info here.
#
# You can add excludes here, but the script will always detect those files as
# missing and will add them back to the file list.  This may generate
# complaints from rsync, but should not cause any problems, though it is almost
# certainly better to use the provided FILTEREXP to do exclusion instead.
#
# Note that some of these options may be required for proper operation of the
# script.  You really should be careful if you change things here, as the
# default value is carefully crafted and rsync can react in unexpected ways to
# seeminly compatible sets of arguments.
RSYNCOPTS=(-aSH -f 'R .~tmp~' --stats --preallocate --delay-updates --out-format='@ %i  %n%L')

# By default quick-fedora-mirror will try to detect and recover from an aborted
# rsync run by moving any already downloaded files into place before
# processing,  Define NORSYNCRECOVERY (to anything) to prevent this.
# NORSYNCRECOVERY=

# Define KEEPDIRTIMES (to anything) to make a third rsync call which restores
# the timestamps of any directories which were modified after file removal.
# This won't ensure that timestamps are always up to date, but its good enough
# if you don't modify your repository locally.  Maintaining directory
# timestamps isn't important for mirroring in any case.
# KEEPDIRTIMES=

# DEFINE CHECKIN_SITE and CHECKIN_PASSWORD to perform a mirrormanager checkin
# at the completion of the run if rsync succeeded without error.  These values
# should match the master site name and site password you have configured in
# mirrormanager.
# CHECKIN_HOST will default to the output of the hostname command; you must set
# it manually if that does not match the hostname you have configured in
# mirrormanager.
# The "curl", "bzip2" and "base64" commands must be installed in order to
# perform mirrormanager checkins.
# CHECKIN_SITE=
# CHECKIN_PASSWORD=
# CHECKIN_HOST=

# If you have configured multiple mirrormanager hostnames to virtually
# spread the modules/categories you mirror between them, then you can configure
# per-module checkin hosts with variables liks the following.
# If a specific CHECKIN_HOST_* setting is not configured, then CHECKIN_HOST
# above will be used.
# Note that the module name is used, not the mirrormanager category, and that
# '-' in the module name is replaced by '_' to make a legal variable name.
# Most sites will hnot need this; it is only necessary when you mirror too many
# modules for mirrormanager to handle in a single checkin or crawl.
# CHECKIN_HOST_fedora_archive=
# CHECKIN_HOST_fedora_alt=

# Verbosity levels - info sent to stdout; usually this gets mailed to root when

# When q-f-m fails to run becuse it is already running, it checks the time
# since the last successful run.  If that is larger than this value, it logs a
# serious error.  Thid helps to detect a hung run or issues with slow
# transfers.
# WARNDELAY=$((60 * 60 * 24)) # One day

# When q-f-m encounters an error calling rsync, it may (depending on the error)
# sleep and retry.  It will always sleep with exponential backup.  Set
# MAXRETRIES to limit the number of times it retries.

# mktemp will be called after this file is sourced to make a temporary
# directory.  This directory can contain a large amount of data, and that data
# is specified by the server.  If your /tmp is small and you are concerned
# about the server potentially sending extra-huge files and filling things up,
# you can set TMPDIR here.
# TMPDIR=

# A regular expression used to filter the file lists. It must be quoted (or
# very carefully escaped). Entries matching this expression will not be synced
# and are expected not to be present locally. They will also be ignored by
# quick-fedora-hardlink. Cannot contain commas. Run against the file list that
# includes sizes (by quick-fedora-mirror) and the fullfiletimelist (by
# quick-fedora-hardlink), so don't use expressions that would match those
# metadata (which are digit strings and single characters). Example is a heavy
# filter which gives you an x86_64-only mirror with source packages, debuginfo
# packages, Alpha and Beta releases, and most image files excluded.
# FILTEREXP='(/i386|/armhfp|/source|/SRPMS|/debug/|\.iso|\.img|\.qcow2|\.raw\.xz|\.box|/releases/test)'
