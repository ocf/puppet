  # We set up two separate jenkins user:
  #
  #   - jenkins-slave:
  #         Used for running build jobs with possibly untrusted code.
  #   - jenkins-deploy:
  #         Used for running *trusted* deploy jobs from a user that has access
  #         to the ocfdeploy keytab. This user should NEVER run untrusted code.
  #
  # This is in addition to the `jenkins` user that is configured by the
  # Debian package, which is used for hosting the Jenkins master.
  #
  # Within Jenkins, we configure two "slaves" which are really the same server,
  # but launched by executing the slave.jar binaries as the appropriate users
  # (via sudo). We then set access controls on the jobs so that only trusted
  # jobs run as `jenkins-deploy`.
  #
  # This is a bit complicated, but it allows us both better security (we no
  # longer have to worry that anybody who can get some code built can become
  # ocfdeploy, which is a privileged user account) and protects Jenkins
  # somewhat against bad jobs that might e.g. delete files or crash processes.
  #
  # Of course, in many cases once code builds successfully, we ship it off
  # somewhere where it gets effectively run as root anyway. But this feels a
  # little safer.
